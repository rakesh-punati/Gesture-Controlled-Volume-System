# Gesture-Controlled-Volume-System

🎛 Gesture Controlled Volume System
A real-time touchless volume control system built using Computer Vision and AI-based hand tracking.
This project detects the distance between the thumb and index finger and converts it into system volume control commands.
Introduction
This project demonstrates a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system that allows users to control system volume using hand gestures instead of a keyboard or mouse.
* Touchless and hygienic interaction
* Uses real-time webcam input
* AI-powered hand landmark detection
*	Smooth volume transition with noise reduction
Technologies Used
*	Programming Language: Python
*	Computer Vision: OpenCV
*	Hand Tracking: MediaPipe
*	System Control: PyAutoGUI
* Numerical Operations: NumPy
* Key Features
* Real-time gesture recognition
* FPS counter display
* Visual feedback (circles & connecting lines)
* Smooth volume transition
* Noise reduction using threshold buffer
* Lightweight & efficient implementation
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a real-time gesture-based volume control system using Computer Vision.
It enhances Human-Computer Interaction by providing:
*	Cost-effective solution
